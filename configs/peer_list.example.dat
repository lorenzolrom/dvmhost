# Digital Voice Modem - Peer ID Access Control List
#
# This file sets the valid peer IDs allowed on a FNE. This file should always end with an empty line!
#
#   * PEER ID           [REQUIRED]  - Unique ID for a peer.
#                                       Peer IDs are valid numbers between 1 and 999999999.
#   * PEER PASSWORD     [REQUIRED]  - Unique password for this peer to use when authenticating.
#   * PEER REPLICATION  [OPTIONAL]  - Flag indicating whether or not the peer connection is another FNE and will receive
#                                       full configuration from this FNE. When peer replication is set, and the connection is 
#                                       another FNE, that FNE will receive all the talkgroups, radio ID lists, and 
#                                       peer lists from this FNE, it will also receive all system traffic.
#   * PEER ALIAS        [OPTIONAL]  - Textual name alias for the peer.
#   * CAN REQUEST KEYS  [OPTIONAL]  - Flag indicating the peer connection is allowed to request encryption keys.
#                                       If this flag is disabled (0), and the connected peer requests and encryption key
#                                       the encryption key request will be dropped and ignored.
#   * CAN ISSUE INHIBIT [OPTIONAL]  - Flag indicating the peer connection is capable of transmitting inhibit packets.
#                                       If this flag is disabled (0), and the connected peer issues an inhibit to the network
#                                       this FNE will drop the packet and ignore it.
#   * HAS CALL PRIORITY [OPTIONAL]  - Flag indicating the peer connection has call priority.
#                                       If this flag is disabled (0), and the connected peer tries to transmit over an on going
#                                       call, normal call collision rules are applied to the traffic being transmitted.
#                                       If this flag is enabled (1), and the connected peer tries to transmit over an on going
#                                       call, call collision rules are ignored, and the peer is given priority.
